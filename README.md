# Deprecation

cordis has been deprecated. I ([DD](https://github.com/didinele)) joined the [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs)
team in 2022 Summer when I noticed the project was finally taking a direction I liked. Thanks to the hard work of many people
and to my experience from building cordis, d.js is an amazing place now building micro-serviced bots thanks to `@discordjs/ws` and `@discordjs/core`.

# Packages

Cordis is cut up in the form of multiple packages/libraries:
