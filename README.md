# About
cordis is a fully modular, micro-service based [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) wrapper around the [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro)

It is cut up in multiple packages/libraries:

- `@cordis/rest`, containing a REST manager for the Discord API, including a rate limiting system and various utilities
- `@cordis/gateway`, containing a very flexible way of connecting to Discord's gateway

But also services that hook into RabbitMQ using the libraries mentioned above:

- `@cordis/rest-service`
- `@cordis/gateway-service`
